This is the course website. This page shows information about the consultation times, MoVE, and Schedule and lecture notes.

The "Assessments" tab above provides information about all assessment for ETC5510.

## Expectations 

- Unless your question is a personal issue or an administrative matter, please do not send us direct email. The [ED site](https://edstem.org/) is appropriate for questions related to the course material.
- For personal or administrative issues, the email contact is: ETC5510.Clayton-x@monash.edu
- ED is used for asking for help, reading and lab exercise quizzes and assignment turn in. Only your name and email is stored in this system.
- **If you register after the start of the semester** or if you
  miss a lecture/lab, it is your responsibility to catch up with
  missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in,
  and getting assigned to a group for team work.
- **This class is now online, due to extenuating circumstances**. Please
do not attend in person, lectures will be made available online via moodle.
Given the current circumstances, it may be best to enrol second semester. An alternative is to complete
a microcredential offered online. Completing this is equivalent and gives you credit for ETC5510, and would. keep you on track for MBAt. This started Mar 2 but it is still possible to enrol up until Mar 11. More information is available at  https://www.futurelearn.com/microcredentials/data-driven-decision-making. 


## MoVE

Borrow a laptop: If you are enrolled in a MoVE unit and forget your laptop, or do not own one as yet, please visit Monash Connect to borrow a laptop for an activity or part of a day:

**Clayton: 7.45AM - 5PM**

You may be required to provide proof of ID (student card or personal ID) in order to borrow a laptop. We have a limited amount of laptops available for students to borrow (during semester only). Collect an IT Services ticket when you go to Monash Connect.

## Consultation times

Consultations begin from Week 2 (16th March)

- Steph Kobakian: Tuesday 12pm-2pm and Friday 1:30pm-2:30pm
- Sherry Zhang: Thursday 2pm-5pm
- Stuart Lee: Monday 4:30pm-5:30pm and Wednesday 4:30pm-5:30pm
